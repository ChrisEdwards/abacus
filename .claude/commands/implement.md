Implement the secified bead. If one was not specified, list all beads that are open and have a `human-reviewed` label. Show them in a numbered list and ask the user to type the number or bead id of the one to implement.

Then you should be in plan mode. If not, ask the user to put you in plan mode.
Then make a plan for this implementation.
Use context7 to ensure its idiomatic using the existing libraries.
Ensure it is a delightful experience for the user.
Implement clean code, well factored. Favor simplicity, intuitiveness, and functionality.

Ensure you write tests for any code you change or create. This is important.
Ensure you update documentation if applicable. 
Ensure you test the changes using tmux if applicable.

When you complete the bead, write the details of what you did and the commit hashes to the bead comments.
