They must manually check GitHub releases or remember to run `brew upgrade`. This leads to users running outdated versions and missing bug fixes, new features, and security updates.\n\n## Solution\nAdd an update notification system that:\n1. Checks GitHub releases API at startup (async, non-blocking)\n2. Shows a toast notification when an update is available\n3. For Homebrew users: shows `brew upgrade abacus` instructions\n4. For direct download users: offers one-key auto-update via [U] hotkey\n\n## Design Document\nSee: docs/plans/2025-12-25-update-notification-design.md\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n- **Startup only**: Check once at launch, don't poll during use\n- **Non-blocking**: Async check doesn't slow down app startup\n- **Respect package managers**: Homebrew users get instructions, not auto-update (avoids desyncing brew's package tracking)\n- **Graceful failures**: Network errors silently ignored, update failures show manual instructions\n- **10 second toast**: Long enough to read and act, short enough to not annoy\n- **Skip for dev builds**: Version=\"dev\" skips update check entirely\n\n## User Experience\nHomebrew user sees:\n```\n ⬆ Update available: v0.6.2\n   Run: brew upgrade abacus     [10s]\n```\n\nDirect download user sees:\n```\n ⬆ Update available: v0.6.2\n   Press [U] to update           [10s]\n```\n\n## Implementation Components\n1. internal/update/checker.go - Version checker (GitHub API)\n2. internal/update/updater.go - Auto-updater (download + atomic replace)\n3. internal/ui/view_toasts.go - Update toast UI\n4. cmd/abacus/main.go - Startup integration\n5. internal/config/config.go - Skip flag configuration","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-24T15:33:54.338313-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T01:10:55.900064-05:00"}

{"id":"ab-qdh0.3","title":"Handle relates-to dependency type in builder","description":"Update the graph builder to handle the new `relates-to` dependency type alongside the existing `related` type.\n\n## Background\n\nBeads has two similar but distinct dependency types:\n- `related` (legacy): One-way, created via `bd dep add X Y --type related`\n- `relates-to` (new): Bidirectional, created via `bd relate X Y`\n\nThe `bd relate` command creates TWO dependency records (X→Y and Y→X), both with type `relates-to`. Currently abacus only handles `related`, so issues linked via `bd relate` don't appear in the \"See Also\" section.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn internal/graph/builder.go, update the switch case:\n\n```go\ncase \"related\", \"relates-to\":\n    if related, ok := nodeMap[dep.TargetID]; ok {\n        // Dedup check: relates-to stores both directions, avoid double-linking\n        alreadyLinked := false\n        for _, r := range node.Related {\n            if r.Issue.ID == related.Issue.ID {\n                alreadyLinked = true\n                break\n            }\n        }\n        if !alreadyLinked {\n            node.Related = append(node.Related, related)\n            related.Related = append(related.Related, node)\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Why Dedup Check?\n\n- For `related`: We add both directions manually (existing behavior)\n- For `relates-to`: Both directions already exist in storage, so without dedup we'd add each link twice\n\nThe dedup check makes the code work correctly for both old and new dependency types.\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nThis is purely additive - we're adding a new case to the switch.

Surface struct + constructors exist with style fields for Text, TextMuted, Accent, Error, Success, BorderNeutral, BorderError.\n2. App.View (non-overlay path) builds its content by writing into a primary surface/canvas instead of string joins where feasible; document any remaining strings.\n3.

The TUI correctly uses only `--title`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--labels`, and `--assignee`.\n\n### Most Likely Explanation:\nThis error was a **stale/cached error** from a previous operation that was displayed at the wrong time. The error handling in the TUI may have shown an old error from `m.lastError` when a subsequent operation completed.\n\n### Verification:\n- Tested `bd create` with `--description` flag - works correctly on both versions\n- Reviewed TUI code - no usage of `--description` flag\n- Checked session logs - error appeared as toast after successful bead creation\n\n### Recommendation:\nThis appears to be a **non-reproducible error** from timing/caching issues during manual testing.

Maybe it doesn't need comments. Maybe it's just the beads. I bet there's a way to do that then, because comments would be only shown whenever you open it in the details pane.\n\nSo the refresh may just be able to use the last updated time for all the beads. \n\nThis would require us to be able to swap out beads in memory as they change and just replace them with the new bead, which is also a feature that I had suggested for updating the UI in the tree whenever a bead changes.

Abacus currently only supports these three statuses, which causes issues when viewing beads databases that use the extended statuses.\n\nThis epic tracks the work to add proper support for:\n- **blocked** - Manual blocking (distinct from dependency-calculated blocking)\n- **deferred** - Deliberately postponed (on ice) issues\n- **tombstone** - Soft-deleted issues (internal handling only)\n\nNote: pinned status is deliberately excluded from this scope as it is designed for multi-agent workflows and does not have a clear use case in single-user TUI context.\n\n## Problem Statement\nWhen abacus encounters issues with status values like blocked or deferred, it either:\n1. Fails validation in the domain layer\n2. Displays them incorrectly (wrong icon, wrong color, wrong filtering)\n3. Prevents users from setting these statuses via the UI\n\nThis creates friction for users who use both bd CLI and abacus TUI.\n\n## Solution Approach\nAdd first-class support for blocked and deferred statuses with appropriate icons, colors, filtering, and transitions.\n\n### blocked Status\n- Icon: (blocked) - same as dependency-blocked\n- Color: Red (#f26d78)\n- Meaning: User manually marked this as blocked\n\n### deferred Status\n- Icon: (snowflake) - conveys on ice\n- Color: Cool blue/gray\n- Meaning: Deliberately postponed for later\n\n### tombstone Status\n- Internal only - filter out from all views\n- No UI representation needed\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. Issues with blocked/deferred status display correctly\n2. Users can change status via overlay\n3. Ready filter excludes blocked and deferred\n4.

{"id":"ab-qdh0.4","title":"Resolve duplicate_of and superseded_by in builder","description":"Add logic to resolve the `duplicate_of` and `superseded_by` issue fields into Node pointers after building the nodeMap.\n\n## Background\n\nUnlike other relationships stored in the dependencies table, `duplicate_of` and `superseded_by` are **issue-level fields**. When you run:\n- `bd duplicate ab-123 --of ab-456` → sets ab-123.duplicate_of = \"ab-456\"\n- `bd supersede ab-old --with ab-new` → sets ab-old.superseded_by = \"ab-new\"\n\nThese are string IDs in the issue JSON that need to be resolved to actual Node pointers for display.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn internal/graph/builder.go, after building nodeMap and processing dependencies:\n\n```go\n// Resolve graph link fields (duplicate_of, superseded_by)\nfor _, node := range nodeMap {\n    if node.Issue.DuplicateOf != \"\" {\n        if canonical, ok := nodeMap[node.Issue.DuplicateOf]; ok {\n            node.DuplicateOf = canonical\n        }\n    }\n    if node.Issue.SupersededBy != \"\" {\n        if replacement, ok := nodeMap[node.Issue.SupersededBy]; ok {\n            node.SupersededBy = replacement\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n**Referenced issue not in current view:**\nIf the canonical/replacement issue isn't loaded (filtered out, different status filter, etc.), the pointer stays nil. The detail view handles this gracefully by only rendering the section when the pointer is non-nil.\n\n**Circular references:**\nTheoretically impossible - an issue can't be marked as duplicate of itself (beads CLI prevents this), and the supersedes relationship creates a linear chain. But even if data was corrupted, the code is safe since we're just looking up by ID.\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nWhen parsing beads v0.0.30 data:\n- `node.Issue.DuplicateOf` will be \"\" (empty string)\n- `node.Issue.SupersededBy` will be \"\" (empty string)\n- The if-checks ensure we skip resolution for empty strings\n- No errors, no impact on existing functionality","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:23:39.821268-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T02:23:39.821268-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ab-qdh0.4","depends_on_id":"ab-qdh0","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:23:39.822125-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"ab-qdh0.4","depends_on_id":"ab-qdh0.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:24:33.683255-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"ab-qdh0.4","depends_on_id":"ab-qdh0.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:24:34.46499-05:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"ab-qdh0.4","depends_on_id":"ab-qdh0.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T02:31:00.099083-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"ab-vb42","title":"Establish outerWidth/innerWidth box model for UI components","description":"## Problem\n\nUI components leak box model implementation details. Callers must know about lipgloss quirks (border renders outside Width()) and manually subtract magic numbers (-2, -4) when sizing components. This leads to:\n\n- Scattered `-2` and `-4` calculations throughout the codebase\n- Confusion about what \"width\" means in different contexts\n- Repeated bugs when someone forgets the adjustment\n- No clear terminology for the two width concepts\n\n## Solution\n\nEstablish **outerWidth** and **innerWidth** as standard terminology with a clear relationship:\n\n```\nparent.innerWidth = child.outerWidth\n```\n\n### Terminology\n\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **outerWidth** | How wide the box looks on screen (including border) |\n| **innerWidth** | Room inside for content (after border + padding) |\n\n### Visual Model\n\n```\nOverlay\n├── outerWidth: 60\n├── innerWidth: 54  ───────┐\n│                          │  parent.innerWidth = child.outerWidth\nComboBox                   │\n├── outerWidth: 54  ←──────┘\n├── innerWidth: 50\n│\nText content: 50 chars\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n1. **Each component owns its box model** - border/padding calculations are internal implementation details\n2. **Parent passes outerWidth to child** - \"here's how wide you should be\"\n3. **Child calculates its own innerWidth** - \"here's how much room I have inside\"\n4. **Style functions encapsulate lipgloss quirks** - caller never sees `-2`\n5. **Consistent naming** - use outerWidth/innerWidth everywhere\n\n### Implementation Pattern\n\n**BEFORE (broken - leaks lipgloss quirk):**\n```go\n// Caller must know about border\ninputStyle := styleComboBoxInput().Width(c.Width - 2)\n```\n\n**AFTER (encapsulated):**\n```go\n// Component handles its own box model\ninputStyle := borderedInputStyle(c.outerWidth, c.focused)\n\nfunc borderedInputStyle(outerWidth int, focused bool) lipgloss.Style {\n    return lipgloss.NewStyle().\n        Border(lipgloss.RoundedBorder()).\n        BorderForeground(borderColor(focused)).\n        Padding(0, 1).\n        Width(outerWidth - 2)  // lipgloss quirk hidden here\n}\n```\n\n### Files to Change\n\n1. **combobox.go**:\n   - Style functions take outerWidth parameter\n   - Remove `-2` from View() call sites\n   - Add innerWidth() helper for content sizing\n   - Use currentThemeWrapper() for dimming support\n\n2. **chipcombobox.go**:\n   - Consistent with combobox changes\n\n3. **chips.go**:\n   - Document Width as outerWidth\n   - Use currentThemeWrapper() for dimming support\n\n4. **overlay_base.go**:\n   - Rename ContentWidth() to InnerWidth() for consistency (or alias)\n   - Document the outerWidth/innerWidth relationship\n\n5. **Add constants** (in overlay_base.go or new layout.go):\n   ```go\n   const (\n       BorderSize      = 2  // lipgloss RoundedBorder adds 2 to visual width\n       InputPadding    = 2  // Padding(0, 1) = 2 horizontal\n       InputBoxOverhead = 4  // BorderSize + InputPadding\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] No `-2` or `-4` magic numbers at call sites\n- [ ] All style functions that create bordered boxes take outerWidth\n- [ ] Components calculate innerWidth internally\n- [ ] outerWidth/innerWidth terminology documented\n- [ ] All components use currentThemeWrapper() for dimming support","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-12T13:57:12.046503-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T13:58:55.124066-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T13:58:55.124068-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ab-vb42","depends_on_id":"ab-kfms","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-12T13:58:43.454574-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"ab-z6vl","title":"Determine how to prioritize beads beyond course-grained priority","description":"When using beads for my personal to-do, I want to have a list of the things I'm going to do next. Kind of a linear list, just ordered list. So I need to think a bit how I should do that in beads and be able to show it in Abacus.\n\nJira has a good way to do that where they have a rank field and they can just drag and drop things to reprioritize them. I feel like I need something like that because I need to be able to look at the most important things to work on. And that's not dictated by any of the fields in beads today.\n\nThere is a priority field, but it's so granular that I would just have like five categories with a ton of things in each category. But I need to be able to very fluidly reprioritize my work on the fly. And a terminal UI is probably not the easiest way to do that, but I'm sure we can find a way. \n\nThis involves two aspects here. One is how will I store the priority in a way that I can reorder that pretty dynamically for things that need to get done. And the other is how will I do that in a UI to make it user friendly? Perhaps we have different views we can use, such as a custom priority view, or priority by label, or priority by project. Maybe we can create some custom views to display these items in different ways based on what my use case is. Perhaps even having a separate list other than the tree, which is the priority to-do list. The tree shows you the structure, the priority list shows you the next few things to work on. I don't know, I need to think through this.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-05T12:39:45.768072-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T13:36:11.03766-05:00"}
